abstract: We study the possibilities of a search for the light and weakly interacting gauge boson in the gauged $L_\mu - L_\tau$ model. Introducing the kinetic mixing at the tree level, the allowed parameter regions for the gauge coupling and kinetic mixing parameter are presented. Then, we analyze one photon plus missing event within the allowed region and show that a search for the light gauge boson will be possible at the Belle-II experiment. We also analyze the neutrino trident production process in neutrino beam experiments.
